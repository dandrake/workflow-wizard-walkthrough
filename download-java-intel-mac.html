  ⚠️
  <strong
    >If and ONLY if you are using a Mac AND your Mac has an Intel
    processor</strong
  >️, then the Adoptium website has an issue where it may not lead you to the
  correct version by default.
</p>

<p>
  Look for the “Download Temurin for macOS…” message.
  <strong>If it says x64,</strong> then it’s correct; click “Latest LTS
  Release.”
</p>

<!-- empty paragraph to get the blank line; you're not supposed to have ol inside p, both -- are block-level elements. -->
<p></p>
<strong>However, if it says “aarch64,”</strong> then you must choose the correct
version manually:
<ol type="1">
  <li>Click “Other platforms and versions”</li>
  <li>Choose Operating System → macOS, Architecture → x64</li>
  <li>
    This should give you exactly <strong>one</strong> version in the search
    results
  </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>.pkg</strong> link to download it.</li>
</ol>
