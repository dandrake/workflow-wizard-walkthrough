  Create an account at
  <a href="https://macdevgarden.slack.com">macdevgarden.slack.com</a> if you
  don‚Äôt already have one. Use your <strong>Macalester email</strong>. You will
  use this account to communicate with the instructor, preceptors, and
  classmates. We will use the channel called
  <a href="https://macdevgarden.slack.com/archives/C09D4KYT02V">#comp127-f25</a>
  (üîólink last updated fall 2025).

  This Slack account is
  <strong>only visible to the Macalester community;</strong> it is not visible
  to the general public, and you will not also use it in a professional
  capacity. Please use your full name (the one people know you by at Macalester)
  for this account. If you use just your first name, or a clever alias, it‚Äôs
  very hard for profs and classmates to know who you are!
</p>

<p>
  Please note that you need to create a
  <strong>new account for <em>this</em> MSCS Slack workspace</strong> even if
  you already have a different Slack account for <em>some other</em> Slack
  workspace.

<p>
  It is a good idea to leave a tab open for Slack ‚Äî or better yet, install the
  <a href="https://slack.com/downloads/">Slack app</a>.
</p>

<p>Check your Slack notification settings, and adjust them to your taste.</p>
