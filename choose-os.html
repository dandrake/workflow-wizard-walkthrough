Some of the instructions differ based on what kind of computer you are using.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Windows users:</strong> you have it easy, just select Windows below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Mac users:</strong> we need to know what kind of processor your
      computer has. It's either "Intel", or "Apple Silicon".
    </p>

    <p>
      Go to the Apple Menu → About This Mac, and look for a heading named either
      Processor or Chip. It will say something that contains either the word
      “Intel” or the word “Apple.” Ask for help if you’re not sure about this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Linux user?</strong> If you are using Linux, just choose anything.
    We presume you are adventurous enough to adapt the instructions as needed.
    🙂🐧 There are some references to Linux sprinkled through the rest of these
    instructions, though.
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>
    Related terminology: you'll see these terms when referring to the operating
    system and processor. They are sometimes called the "architecture" or
    "platform".
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Intel Macs and Windows processors</dt>
    <dd>
      x64, x86-64 (but what about Windows ARM? The Surface, Copilot PCs, etc?)
    </dd>
    <dt>Apple Silicon</dt>
    <dd>
      aarch6, arm64; the chips that are called "M1", "M2", and so on are Apple
      Silicon.
    </dd>

    <dt>macOS installer files</dt>
    <dd>
      End with <code>dmg</code>, <code>pkg</code>, sometimes <code>zip</code>
    </dd>

    <dt>Windows installer files</dt>
    <dd>
      End with <code>exe</code>, <code>msi</code>, sometimes <code>zip</code>
    </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

<p>Choose your system below.</p>

<p>
  <button
    class="action-btn action-btn-enabled"
    onclick='window.workflowManager.setPlatform("intel-mac")'
  >
    Intel Mac
  </button>
  <button
    class="action-btn action-btn-enabled"
    onclick='window.workflowManager.setPlatform("apple-silicon-mac")'

    Apple Silicon Mac

    Windows
  </button>

  In the rest of these instructions, those that don't apply should be dimmed a
  bit -- but you can hover over them to see them, if you like. Here are some
  samples:
</p>

<div class="intel-mac other-platform">
  <p>
    You selected Intel Mac and will see instructions for those displayed like
    this.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="apple-silicon-mac other-platform">
  <p>
    You selected Apple Silicon Mac and will see instructions for those displayed
    like this.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="win other-platform">
  <p>
    You selected Windows and will see instructions for those displayed like
    this.
  </p>
</div>
