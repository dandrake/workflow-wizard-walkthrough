Some of the instructions differ based on what kind of computer you are using.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Windows users:</strong> you have it easy, just select Windows below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Mac users:</strong> we need to know what kind of processor your
      computer has. It's either "Intel", or "Apple Silicon".
    </p>

    <p>
      Go to the Apple Menu ‚Üí About This Mac, and look for a heading named either
      Processor or Chip. It will say something that contains either the word
      ‚ÄúIntel‚Äù or the word ‚ÄúApple.‚Äù Ask for help if you‚Äôre not sure about this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Related terminology: you'll see these terms when referring to Intel or
      Apple Silicon Macs. They are sometimes called the "architecture".
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Intel: x64, x86-64</li>
      <li>
        Apple Silicon: aarch6, arm64; the chips that are called "M1", "M2", and
        so on are Apple Silicon.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Linux user?</strong> If you are using Linux, just choose anything.
    We presume you are adventurous enough to adapt the instructions as needed.

  apply should be dimmed a bit.
