Some of the instructions differ based on what kind of computer you are using.

      <strong>Mac users:</strong> we need to know what kind of processor your
      computer has. It's either "Intel", or "Apple Silicon".
    </p>

    <p>
      Go to the Apple Menu ‚Üí About This Mac, and look for a heading named either
      Processor or Chip. It will say something that contains either the word
      ‚ÄúIntel‚Äù or the word ‚ÄúApple.‚Äù Ask for help if you‚Äôre not sure about this.

    <strong>Linux user?</strong> If you are using Linux, just choose anything.
    We presume you are adventurous enough to adapt the instructions as needed.
    üôÇüêß There are some references to Linux sprinkled through the rest of these
    instructions, though.

    system and processor. They are sometimes called the "architecture" or

  In the rest of these instructions, those that don't apply should be dimmed a
  bit -- but you can hover over them to see them, if you like. Here are some
  samples:
</p>

<div class="intel-mac other-platform">
  <p>
    You selected Intel Mac and will see instructions for that system displayed
    like this.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="apple-silicon-mac other-platform">
  <p>
    You selected Apple Silicon Mac and will see instructions for that system
    displayed like this.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="win other-platform">
  <p>
    You selected Windows and will see instructions for that system displayed
    like this.

      >In these instructions, if all the different instructions are dimmed
      out:</strong
    >
    There's a bug we've seen in some browsers and some situations where the
    instructions for your system are dimmed out. This is a problem with the
    JavaScript code that creates the computer-specific instructions that we
    haven't 100% figured out yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If you see this problem, to fix it:</strong> just try reloading the
    page. In our testing, that generally resolves the problem. If even that
    doesn't work: (1) tell the instructor about it and (2) just hover your mouse
    over the section for your system -- that will make the instructions more
    visible.
