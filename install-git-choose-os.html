  <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> is a <em>version control system</em>: it
  allows you to track modifications to your code, and to remember past versions
  of it, and work with multiple current versions. It also allows multiple people
  to be working on the same code. In this course, though, the key feature is
  that the GitHub website "speaks git": your local git (via VS Code) will send
  your code to GitHub, and you'll use that for submitting assignments.

<p>Which operating system are you using?</p>

<p>
  (If you are using Linux, you probably already have git installed. And if you
  donâ€™t, then you probably enjoy puzzling out installations for yourself
  anyway.)
