  The next step depends on whether your Mac has an Intel or Apple Silicon
  processor.

<p>
  To find out which one you have: go to the Apple Menu → About This Mac, and
  look for a heading named either <strong>Processor</strong> or
  <strong>Chip</strong>. It will say something that contains either the word
  “Intel” or the word “Apple.” Ask for help if you’re not sure about this.

<p>Choose the processor you have.</p>
