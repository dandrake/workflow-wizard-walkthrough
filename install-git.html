<p>
  <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> is a <em>version control system</em>: it
  allows you to track modifications to your code, and to remember past versions
  of it, and work with multiple current versions. It also allows multiple people
  to be working on the same code. In this course, though, the key feature is
  that the GitHub website "speaks git": your local git (via VS Code) will send
  your code to GitHub, and you'll use that for submitting assignments.

  (If you are using Linux, you probably already have git installed. And if you
  don’t, then you probably enjoy puzzling out installations for yourself
  anyway.)

        Open Spotlight by pressing <strong>command-space</strong>, or by

    <li>
      <p>
        The “top hit” should be an application called Terminal.
        <strong>Open it</strong>.

      <p>
        ⚠️ <strong>CAUTION:</strong> be careful to type exactly what you see: a
        space after the word “git,” then two dashes, then no space before the
        word “version.” All of that matters.

      <p><strong>Press return</strong>.</p>

        ...where it says “git version” followed by a version number, then you

        includes “<strong>No developer tools found</strong>” or “<strong

        <li>
          Copy and paste this into the Terminal, and press return:

          It will ask for your computer password.
          <strong>You won’t be able to see your own typing</strong>, but it is
          working! Type your password and press return.

        <li>
          Now copy and paste this into the Terminal:

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>

            The installation will take a few minutes. When it’s done, go back to
            that Terminal window and try typing
            <code>git --version</code> again. You should now get a version
            number like the screenshot above.
