      >official document</a
    >. That document is the official, authoritative version. (For now at least.)
    We are testing this version in fall 2025.

    Because it's new, we ask that if you follow this version, you'll give us
    some feedback when you're done.

  This interactive document will walk you through the initial installation,

<ul>
  <li>Setting up a Github and MSCS Slack account</li>
  <li>Installing a Java development environment</li>
  <li>Installing VS Code</li>
  <li>
    Installing the git version control system and the Github Desktop application
  </li>
  <li>Running your first Java project and experimenting a bit</li>
</ul>

<p>
  And, because this document is new and still being worked on, a final step wil
  be...
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sending us feedback on this document.</li>
</ul>

Let's go!
