Just two final important steps!

      Now, play around with the code. Don‚Äôt have any idea what to do? No
      problem! Make little changes: maybe change the word ‚Äúmacalester‚Äù to
      something else, or change one of the numbers in the code. Run the code
      again to find out what the effect is. (Note: you have to
      <strong>close the window with the dancing letters</strong> before you can
      run the code again.)

    <p>
      If you get errors, you can always use ‚åò-Z (Mac) / ctrl-Z (Windows) to undo
      and try something else. Experiment. See what you can discover.
      <b>Be bold!</b> You won‚Äôt break your computer by changing this code the
      wrong way. üòÅ
    </p>

    <p>
      Not only will you not break your computer, you don't need to worry about
      undoing your changes, or being unable to go back to the original code you
      downloaded: git is a "version control system", which means it records all
      the changes made to the code. In particular, it remembers the exact state
      of the code you originally downloaded. So go ahead and mess with the code!
      You can delete things, add things, save it, type in garbage, and you will
      <em>always</em> be able to go back to the original state.

    <div class="reminder">
      <details>
        <summary>If you do want to throw away all your changes:</summary>

        <p>
          Navigate to the source control pane ‚Üí the three-dots menu near the top
          ‚Üí Changes ‚Üí Discard All Changes. (However, because you never told git
          to remember <em>your</em> changes, after you do this, anything you
          have done will truly be lost.)

    Have fun! <em>That</em> is the real secret of learning to create software.
    And goodness knows you earned it after slogging through all these

Okay, actually, there is one final <em>final</em> step:
