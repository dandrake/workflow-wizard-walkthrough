Just two final important steps!

      <strong>Let your instructor know</strong> that you have it working. Then
      play around with the code. Don’t have any idea what to do? No problem!
      Make little changes: maybe change the word “macalester” to something else,
      or change one of the numbers in the code. Run the code again to find out
      what the effect is. (Note: you have to
      <strong>close the window with the dancing letters</strong> before you can
      run the code again.)

      If you get errors, you can always use ⌘-Z (Mac) / ctrl-Z (Windows) to undo
      and try something else. Experiment. See what you can discover. Be bold!
      You won’t break your computer by changing this code the wrong way. 😁

    Have fun! <em>That</em> is the real secret of learning to create software.
    And goodness knows you earned it after slogging through all these
    instructions.

Okay, actually, there is one final <em>final</em> step:
