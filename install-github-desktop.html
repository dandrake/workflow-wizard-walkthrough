      it is still waiting for you to log in, click the Cancel button, and then
      try the option that says “Sign in to GitHub.com using your username and
      password” instead.

    <p>
      If you do see this screen, do enter your real name, but don’t change the
      email! <strong>Click Continue</strong>.
    </p>
