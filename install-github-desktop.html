    need to uncompress the downloaded file.

        like this:

      <p>
        <strong>If you don’t see this screen</strong>, and instead it looks like
        it is still waiting for you to log in, click the Cancel button, and then
        try the option that says “Sign in to GitHub.com using your username and
        password” instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do see this screen, do enter your real name, but don’t change the
        email! <strong>Click Continue</strong>.
