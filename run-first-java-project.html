  With these steps, you will use all the pieces together: Java, VS Code, git,
  and GitHub Desktop.

      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a></strong> is a free program
        that tracks changes to your code, and helps you share code between
        computers. Its job is to keep a history of the work you’ve done on your
        code, and give you the ability to share that work with collaborators.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a></strong> is a commercial
        service that uses git to store your code in the cloud. While git gives
        you the <em>ability</em> to move code between computers, GitHub provides
        <em>actual computers</em> — “servers” — to move it to and from. You will
        connect to GitHub’s servers through the developer tools you use on your
        computer, and also through the github.com web site.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong
          ><a href="https://github.com/apps/desktop">GitHub Desktop</a></strong
        >
        is an application that runs on your computer, made by the folks at
        GitHub to help you use their service. When we say “open the GitHub
        Desktop app,” we specifically mean this app on your computer — not the
        github.com web site.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is all a lot to take in right now! It will become clearer with
      practice.

      Click the <strong>Clone a Repository from the Internet…</strong> button.

    />

    <p>
      This tells the app that you would like to get some code from GitHub in the
      cloud and copy it to your own computer. The code you are going to get is a
      “welcome to comp127” app that you can use to test your installation.
      Copying a particular bit of code from elsewhere to your computer is what
      we mean when we say "clone a repository".

      Take a look at the "Local Path" field. This tells GitHub Desktop where to
      create a copy of the project on your computer:<br />

    <p>
      Perhaps you might like to create a comp127 folder for this class, and put
      welcome-app inside it. Perhaps you already have a system for organizing
      your work. Perhaps the place GitHub Desktop chose for you is perfectly
      fine — but you still need to note where it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can choose! No sensible answer is wrong here.
      <strong>The only wrong answer is not paying attention.</strong>

      If everything worked, you should see a window like the screenshot below.
      <strong>Look at the Current Repository name</strong> in the upper left; it
      should say "welcome-app." If it does, then click the
      <strong>Open in Visual Studio Code</strong> button:

      <strong>If you didn’t get any of these messages</strong>, then it is
      possible that VS Code either can’t find the VS Code Java extension or
      can’t find Java itself. Continue with setup — we’ll know for sure when you
      try running the Welcome app!

      Now VS Code should show a message in the lower right saying "Opening Java
      Project." VS Code is doing two things: (1)
      <strong>downloading dependencies</strong>, meaning other code that this
      project's code depends on, and (2) <strong>building this project</strong>,
      meaning that it is turning the code you just cloned into something your
      computer can actually run.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process is very slow the first time you open a Java project — it can
      take several minutes! — but it will be much faster in the future.

      Some things in that code might look familiar to you from your past
      experience. Much of it probably looks like complete gibberish! No matter
      how little or how much of it makes sense to you now, by the end of this
      class you’ll be able to understand all the programming language features
      you see here — and if some things do look familiar, you’ll know something
      new about the underlying principles behind them.
