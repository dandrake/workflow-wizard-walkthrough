<p>
  With these steps, you will use all the pieces together: Java, VS Code, git,
  and GitHub Desktop.
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Open the <strong>GitHub Desktop</strong> <strong>app</strong> if it isn’t
      already open.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a></strong> is a free program
        that tracks changes to your code, and helps you share code between
        computers. Its job is to keep a history of the work you’ve done on your
        code, and give you the ability to share that work with collaborators.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a></strong> is a commercial
        service that uses git to store your code in the cloud. While git gives
        you the <em>ability</em> to move code between computers, GitHub provides
        <em>actual computers</em> — “servers” — to move it to and from. You will
        connect to GitHub’s servers through the developer tools you use on your
        computer, and also through the github.com web site.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong
          ><a href="https://github.com/apps/desktop">GitHub Desktop</a></strong
        >
        is an application that runs on your computer, made by the folks at
        GitHub to help you use their service. When we say “open the GitHub
        Desktop app,” we specifically mean this app on your computer — not the
        github.com web site.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is all a lot to take in right now! It will become clearer with
      practice.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Click the <strong>Clone a Repository from the Internet…</strong> button.
    </p>

    <img
      src="images/run-first-java-project-clone-repo.png"
      alt="GitHub Desktop dialog for creating a new repository, highlighting
             the 'clone a repository from the internet' option"
      style="width: 95%"
    />

    <p>
      This tells the app that you would like to get some code from GitHub in the
      cloud and copy it to your own computer. The code you are going to get is a
      “welcome to comp127” app that you can use to test your installation.
      Copying a particular bit of code from elsewhere to your computer is what
      we mean when we say "clone a repository".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      In the “Clone a Repository” window that appears, choose
      <strong>URL</strong>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Type <code>mac-comp127/welcome-app</code> into the “URL or
      username/repository” text field. ⚠️ <strong>CAUTION:</strong>
      <strong>Don’t press return/enter yet!</strong>

        alt="'clone a repository' dialog showing URL for the mac-comp127 welcome
     app"
      />
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Take a look at the “Local Path” field. This tells GitHub Desktop where to
      create a copy of the project on your computer:<br />
      <img
        src="images/run-first-java-project-repo-local-path.png"
        width="500"

     welcome app will be placed"
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong
        >Where is Github Desktop going to put it? Is that where you want to put
        it?</strong
      >
      Missing these important questions is a common source of student confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you might like to create a comp127 folder for this class, and put
      welcome-app inside it. Perhaps you already have a system for organizing
      your work. Perhaps the place GitHub Desktop chose for you is perfectly
      fine — but you still need to note where it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can choose! No sensible answer is wrong here.
      <strong>The only wrong answer is not paying attention.</strong>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>Once you’re happy with the location, click <strong>Clone</strong>.</li>

  <li>
    <p>
      If everything worked, you should see a window like the screenshot below.
      <strong>Look at the Current Repository name</strong> in the upper left; it
      should say “welcome-app.” If it does, then click the
      <strong>Open in Visual Studio Code</strong> button:

      <img
        src="images/run-first-java-project-current-repo.png"
        width="600"
        alt="GitHub Desktop screen for the newly-cloned welcome-app repository"
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> You can also choose “Open in Visual Studio Code”
      from the Repository menu:
    </p>
    <p>

      />

      <li>
        <p>
          You may be prompted with this window. Select
          <strong>Yes, I trust the authors</strong> by clicking the green
          button.
        </p>

        />
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you get this message, select <strong>Always</strong> (ignoring the
          misplaced comma in the error message):

          />

          <li>
            <p>
              If you get a “Projects are imported into workspace” message, click
              Don’t Show Again.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you get this message, select <strong>Exclude Globally</strong>:

            <p>
              <strong>If you didn’t get any of these messages</strong>, then it
              is possible that VS Code either can’t find the VS Code Java
              extension or can’t find Java itself. Continue with setup — we’ll
              know for sure when you try running the Welcome app!
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong><em>Windows users:</em></strong> This happens sometimes on
              Windows. We aren’t sure why.

            <p>
              If you are not using Windows, or if you tried that and it didn’t
              work, then
              <strong>ask the instructor or a preceptor for help</strong>.

            <p>
              Now VS Code should show a message in the lower right saying
              “Opening Java Project.” VS Code is doing two things: (1)
              <strong>downloading dependencies</strong>, meaning other code that
              this project’s code depends on, and (2)
              <strong>building this project</strong>, meaning that it is turning
              the code you just cloned into something your computer can actually
              run.
            </p>
            <p>
              This process is very slow the first time you open a Java project —
              it can take several minutes! — but it will be much faster in the
              future.
            </p>

          <li>

              If you get this message, select <strong>Enable</strong>:

              If it isn’t already selected, click the <strong>Explorer</strong>
              icon on the left edge of the VS Code window. Then click
              <strong>src</strong> (short for “source”) to see this project’s
              code.

          <li>
            <p>
              Click on <strong>Welcome.java</strong>. You should see a file with
              a bunch of code.

        <p>
          Some things in that code might look familiar to you from your past
          experience. Much of it probably looks like complete gibberish! No
          matter how little or how much of it makes sense to you now, by the end
          of this class you’ll be able to understand all the programming
          language features you see here — and if some things do look familiar,
          you’ll know something new about the underlying principles behind them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It’s time to run the code! Click the
          <strong>icon with a triangle and an insect</strong> on the left edge
          of the window, then click the <strong>Run and Debug</strong> button:
