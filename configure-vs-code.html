    VS Code should start up and show you a welcome screen. You can customize the
    theme and explore the other new user suggestions if you like, but you can
    ignore or close that whole ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù tab whenever you like.

    <p>
      Click the <strong>Extensions</strong> icon in the sidebar on the left. It
      is the one that has three connected squares, plus a tilted fourth square
      floating in the upper right:

      One of the results, probably the very first one, will be the Extension
      Pack for Java from Microsoft. The name may be truncated, as in the picture
      below:

          (The latter was originally called ‚ÄúLiveScript,‚Äù but they changed the

          Both languages are useful and widely used, and you can install both in
          VS Code if you want to. But <strong>Java</strong> is the one you will
          need for this class.

    To verify that the installation worked, press ‚åò-shift-P (Mac) / ctrl-shift-P
    (Windows) to open Visual Studio's "command palette," which lets you search
    for text editor commands by name. Type
    <strong>java</strong> into the command palette. You should see a whole bunch
    of commands whose name starts with "Java:"

    <img

      width="500"
      alt="the VS Code command palette showing many different Java
    commands"
    />

    <p>
      You might not see exactly the same commands as the one in the screenshot.
      That is OK! Just make sure there is a large number of commands that start
      with ‚ÄúJava:‚Äù, whatever the commands are.

  <li id="p9q0r1">
    <a href="#p9q0r1" class="anchor-link" aria-label="Link to this item"></a>
    You don't need to <em>run</em> any of those commands right now; you are just
    checking that they're there. <strong>Press esc</strong> on your keyboard to
    exit the command palette.

      <li>
        Try quitting and reopening Visual Studio Code again and repeat step 6.

      Now we want to add some settings to configure VS Code and the various
      extensions you just installed. Here's the easiest way to get them all at
      once.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open the command palette again and search for
      <strong>"user settings json"</strong>. Select
      <strong>Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)</strong>. That will open a
      new window. If VS Code says the file doesn't exist, create it; otherwise,
      delete everything there, and replace it with the following:
    </p>

    <pre>
{
  "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange",
  "java.server.launchMode": "Standard",
  "java.import.generatesMetadataFilesAtProjectRoot": true,
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": false,
    "plaintext": false,
    "markdown": false,
    "scminput": false
  },
  "extensions.autoUpdate": false,
  "chat.disableAIFeatures": true,
  "vsintellicode.java.completionsEnabled": false
}
</pre
    >

    <p>Save the file and restart Visual Studio Code.</p>
  </li>

  <li id="verify-settings">
    <a
      href="#verify-settings"
      class="anchor-link"
      aria-label="Link to this item"
    ></a>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Optional but nice to do: verify that the settings are applied.</strong
      >
      <strong>Open the VS Code settings</strong> by pressing ‚åò-comma (Mac) or
      ctrl-comma (Windows). If the shortcut isn't working, then navigate to Code
      menu ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Settings (Mac) / File menu ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Settings
      (Windows).
    </p>

    <p>
      Search for <strong>"launch mode"</strong>. Verify that you see "Java >
      Server: Launch Mode" set to <strong>Standard</strong>:

      <img
        src="images/configure-vs-code-launch-mode.png"
        width="550"
        alt="the VS Code Launch Mode setting configuration"
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong
        >If you see that set to "Hybrid", go through the step above and make
        sure your user settings have been correctly saved!</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <div class="reminder urgent">
      <p>
        <strong>
          ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are stuck here and can't get the settings correct:</strong
        >
        ask your instructor or a preceptor for help. Getting those settings
        correct now will save you much confusion, frustration, and sadness
        later.
      </p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you've done all that...</p>

<div class="reminder">
  üéâ You did it! Marvel at your nicely-configured installation of VS Code, then
  proceed to install the git version control system.
