  This step is pretty long. Ask for help if you run into any trouble!

  <li>
    VS Code should start up and show you a welcome screen. You can customize the
    theme and explore the other new user suggestions if you like, but you can
    ignore or close that whole “Getting Started” tab whenever you like.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Click the <strong>Extensions</strong> icon in the sidebar on the left. It
      is the one that has three connected squares, plus a tilted fourth square
      floating in the upper right:
    </p>

      alt="the VS Code extensions icon, as described above"
    />
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Inside the extension list that appears, type <strong>Java</strong> in the
      “Search Extensions” box:
    </p>

      alt="the VS Code search extensions field, with 'java' typed
         into it"
    />
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      One of the results, probably the very first one, will be the Extension
      Pack for Java from Microsoft. The name may be truncated, as in the picture
      below:

      alt="search result for the Extension Pack for Java, where the title
    is cut off and just reads 'Extension P...'"
    />

    <p>
      ...but if it is, you can click the extension to see the full details and
      make sure you have the right one:

      <p>
        ⚠️ <strong>CAUTION</strong> Be sure you getting Java,
        <strong>not</strong> JavaScript! The two are very
        <em>different</em> languages that just happen to have similar names.
      </p>

      <p>
        (The latter was originally called “LiveScript,” but they changed the
        name to “JavaScript” at the last second because they heard that
        something big named “Java” was coming out soon, and they wanted to get
        in on the action. See
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History"
          >Wikipedia on the history of JavaScript</a
        >
        for more details )
      </p>

      <p>
        Both languages are useful and widely used, and you can install both in
        VS Code if you want to. But <strong>Java</strong> is the one you will
        need for this class.
      </p>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>If you can’t find the Java extension pack</strong>, then try
    <a
      href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack"
      >this link</a
    >
    and click the big <strong>Install</strong> button.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once you’re sure you have the correct extension, click
    <strong>Install.</strong> Installation may take a while. Be patient.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may get a welcome screen that encourages you to install a
    <abbr title="Java Development Kit">JDK</abbr>. You shouldn’t need to do
    that; you already installed it earlier in these instructions.
  </li>
  <li>
    To verify that the installation worked, press ⌘-shift-P (Mac) / ctrl-shift-P
    (Windows) to open Visual Studio’s “command palette,” which lets you search
    for text editor commands by name. Type
    <strong>java</strong> into the command palette. You should see a whole bunch
    of commands whose name starts with “Java:”

    <img
      src="images/configure-vs-code-java-commands.png"
      width="500"
      alt="the VS Code command palette showing many different Java
    commands"
    />

    <p>
      You might not see exactly the same commands as the one in the screenshot.
      That is OK! Just make sure there is a large number of commands that start
      with “Java:”, whatever the commands are.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    You don’t need to <em>run</em> any of those commands right now; you are just
    checking that they’re there. <strong>Press esc</strong> on your keyboard to
    exit the command palette.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you <em>don’t</em> see all those Java commands, then:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Try quitting and reopening Visual Studio Code again and repeat step 6.
      </li>
      <li>If that doesn’t work, go back to step 4 and try it again.</li>
      <li>
        If that <em>still</em> doesn’t work, ask the instructor or a preceptor
        for help.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open the VS Code settings</strong> by pressing ⌘-comma (Mac) or
    ctrl-comma (Windows). If the shortcut isn’t working, then navigate to Code
    menu → Preferences → Settings (Mac) / File menu → Preferences → Settings
    (Windows). There are several things to change in the settings:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Search for the setting named “Auto Save”</strong> using the
          “Search settings” box. Set the dropdown to
          <strong>onFocusChange</strong>. This way, every time you click the run
          button, it will save your code first.
        </p>

        <img
          src="images/configure-vs-code-auto-save.png"
          width="550"
          alt="the VS Code auto save setting configuration"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We want to disable “hybrid mode,” which is a temperamental VS Code
          option that sometimes causes projects to not run or load properly.
          <strong>Search for “launch mode”</strong> in the settings search box,
          then set <strong>Java &gt; Server: Launch Mode</strong> to
          <strong>Standard</strong>:
        </p>

        <img
          src="images/configure-vs-code-launch-mode.png"
          width="550"
          alt="the VS Code Launch Mode setting configuration"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Finally,
          <strong>search for “generatesMetadataFilesAtProjectRoot”</strong> in
          the settings search box (you can copy and paste that), and make sure
          that <strong>“Generates Metadata Files At Project Root”</strong> is
          <strong>enabled</strong>
          (i.e. the checkbox is checked):
        </p>

        <img
          src="images/configure-vs-code-generatesmetadatafiles.png"
          width="550"
          alt="the VS Code
        generatesMetaDataFilesAtProjectRoot setting configuration"
        />
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          After changing that last setting, you may get this message in the
          lower right corner:
        </p>

        <pre><code style="font-size: 12px;">⚠️ Java Language Server configuration changed, please restart Visual Studio Code.
Source: Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat...</code></pre>

        <p>
          <strong>Click “Restart Now.”</strong> (Don’t worry, VS Code should
          restart quickly.) <strong>If you don’t see this message,</strong> quit
          and reopen VS Code just to be safe.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
